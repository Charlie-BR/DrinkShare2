WaitTime is used to maximize the time spent with friends - and reduce the time spent waiting in line for social lubricant.  After finding a bar you'd like to visit from our database, you can check the latest wait times from users and determine if the place is moving too slowly for your taste.  You'll be able to see varying wait times for particular types of drinks, whether that's beer, wine, well liquor, or fancy cocktails, you'll know before you head to a bar whether you should bring a book to read while you're in line.  Or, if you're that impatient like us, you'll just go to a different bar entirely with a shorter WaitTime profile.
